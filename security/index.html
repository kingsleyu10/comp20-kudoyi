	<h1>Security Assessment of Jack Hale's 2048 Changes<br>By: Kingsley Udoyi</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Jack hired me to find any potential security and privacy vulnerabilities within his web application. His web application was deployed on Heroku to display the scores and names of individuals that play his 2048 game along with when they achieved that score. He stores all data on a server called Mongo DB which is an add on for Heruko used to communicate with the web server each time a round of the game is finished. 
	</p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>
		First, I took a look at the HTML file of his web application and tried to see if there are any ways to attempt to break the site or find vulnerabilities just by trial and error. I did this for about 30-45 minutes before I exhausted all possibilities I could think of from the top of my head.  Then, I took a look at Jack's source code to confirm my suspicions. Afterwards, I used a free online tool called Web Inspector to do a deep search on the web application and find any potential vulnerabilities. From there, I took a look at all vulnerabilities found and researched the ones that I wasn't 100% familiar with and ways to handle those vulnerabilities. Finally, I implemented hacks to the site and just decided to break his web application.

	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<p>
		Here are a list of all the issues found with Jack's web application:<br>
		<ol>
			Request Headers
			
		</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Issue #1 - Request Header</h3>
	<p>
		Location: Found within definition of use for express<br>
		Serverity: Bad<br>
		Description: This is a bad potential vulnerability because the asterisk ('*') is a wildcard where any website can have access to his web application. This could lead to the endless possibilities where hackers can breach his applciation.<br>

<!--Introduction - Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do
Methodology - Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used
Abstract of Findings - Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.
Issues Found - For each issue that you find, document:
Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
Location or page where issue was found
Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
Proof of vulnerability. Show pictures or it didn't happen.
Resolution. Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved. Show code if possible.
Conclusion - You can also list future considerations and recommendations with costs.
References - A list of references and links that you used for your work.
