1. I'm happy with the fact that I was able to do at least a little bit of hacking on Jack's website. I really really wanted to a hack where images would pop up infinitely on the screen when uploaded but I was not able to figure out the syntax for it completely.

2. I did this assignment with me, myself and I. Oh and I discussed with Samsam about some potential vulnerabilities to consider looking for when working with our partners' code.

3. This assignment took about 3 hours (most of the time went into figuring out how to use Burp Suite and styling my write up).
