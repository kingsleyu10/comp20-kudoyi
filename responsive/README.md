1. I'm proud to state that all aspects of the assignment seem to have been implemented properly. The only downside is that I think I accidently named my folder 'Responsive' instead of 'responsive' and I have no idea how to change it. I will try to seek out a TA to help with this before the deadline.
2. TA Michael Dunkelman was very committed and helpful and made sure I understood why certain things acted the way that they did.
3. 3 Hours mostly because I had an issue with Git through the terminal that took almost an hour to correct.
