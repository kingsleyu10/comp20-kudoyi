1. This assignment took a very long time to understand what was going on but it finally works. All aspects work very well so I am very proud of that.

2. Shoutout to Ming for explaining to me how everything ran behind the scenes.

3. This assignment took about 3 hours to do once I understood what I was doing and how to properly install things (which took way longer than I would have liked).
